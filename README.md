# keylogger
Keystroke logging, often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing, is the action of recording the keys struck on a keyboard, 
typically covertly, so that person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. Data can then be retrieved
by the person operating the logging program.
